# NLP-Vanilla-Language-Model

## Assignment Specification
(i) Pick a corpus;
(ii) check corpus and see what sort of processing you need to do - if you are using the BNC, you do not need to build a perfect tokeniser, an imperfect but practical one will do - of course, the errors will propagate into your language model, but that is ok;
(iii) decide on how you will store the information (i.e. plan ahead);
(iv) split the data into 80/20 (keep the same split for later - i.e. split only once)
(v) first build Unigram frequencies/probabilities, then Bigram and then Trigram; 
(vi) consider storage options so that you build your n-gram models only once;
